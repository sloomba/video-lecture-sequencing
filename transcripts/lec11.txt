Lecture - 11 
Knowledge Representation and Logic 
 
 
In the earlier lectures you have learnt about different search techniques, game theory and 
other aspects of artificial intelligence. Now one of the most important aspects of any 
artificial intelligence activity is how to represent knowledge that is knowledge 
representation. And one of the major techniques of knowledge representation is logic. So 
in this lecture we will be discussing about the different knowledge representation 
schemes. In fact this discussion will be divided into number of lectures and that will 
together constitute a particular module which you are naming as module four of this 
lecture series.  
 
The first technique we will be looking into is propositional logic. In the course of this 
lecture we will gradually come to know about what is propositional logic and how it can 
help us in representing knowledge. But even before coming to the aspect of knowledge 
representation let me first enumerate the objective of this lecture. This lecture will enable 
you to represent simple facts that we use in our day to day life in the language of 
propositional logic. 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:33)  
 
 
 
In order to express anything we need to take the help of some language and in general 
logic is one such language. We will see how we can represent simple facts using 
propositional logic and we will see how we can interpret a propositional logic statement. 
That means, whenever a propositional logic statement is made we have to understand 
what it means. And there is a mechanism that helps us in understanding the meaning of a 
propositional logic statement. Unless we understand what it means we will not be able to 
work with it.  
 
For example, if somebody tells you something in a language that you do not know you 
will not be able to understand it and unless you understand it you will not be able to act 
according to it. Hence it is essential to interpret a propositional logic statement that is the 
second objective of the lecture. And thirdly we will be able to compute the meaning of a 
compound proposition. A compound proposition is essentially a collection, a particular 
way of collecting a number of single propositions and joining them together which forms 
a compound proposition. So, in order to understand meaning of a compound proposition 
first of all we have to understand the meaning of the individual propositions we should be 
able to interpret a proposition and we should also learn as to how we can integrate the 
meanings of the individual propositions to understand the whole.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:22)  
 
 
 
Before delving into the details of knowledge representation first let us look at what is 
meant by intelligence and how is knowledge related to intelligence. There are different 
ways of interpreting knowledge philosophers, scientists, logicians psychologists etc have 
give some meaning to intelligence. Now, what is the role that knowledge plays in an 
intelligent behavior? Let us try to first look at it.  
 
Let us first try to address the question does knowledge have any role at all in 
demonstrating intelligent behavior?  
This is a debatable issue. For example, you may ask that, well this boy is very intelligent 
but he has never gone to school and he does not have enough knowledge but still all of us 
accept that he is intelligent. But the debate remains that what is really meant by 
knowledge? Is it the knowledge that we derive from formal education only?  
Yes that is certainly a part. but besides that there are different other aspects that come 
from day to day experience as we evolve as any human being or animal evolves. They 
acquire from nature some intelligence, some knowledge and that is somehow 
incorporated inside the being and that plays a major role in displaying intelligent 
behavior. Sometimes that is too succinct too intuitive that we do not understand the fact 
that knowledge exists but still that is evident from the behavior. Common sense 
knowledge for example, even without any formal education people can act according to 
their common sense. Instead of going to the details or debate on what is knowledge and 
how far we will say that this is knowledge, this is intuition etc.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:17)  
 
 
 
Let us first look at how this knowledge can help in displaying intelligent behavior in 
whatever form it might be. Here you can see that we are trying to sense something from 
the world, we are sensing. And we have to sense the environment. As soon as we sense 
we accept that and work according to it. We make some decisions and those decisions 
force us to take some actions so that is the action part. So this is the loop that is executed 
all the time in our day to day life. 
 
Now, when this decision maker senses from the environment some event, may be the 
temperature has gone up very high and we have to act accordingly. The decision maker 
takes the help of knowledge to decide on what to do given the environment that it has 
sensed, given the fact that observed. Based on that it makes the decision and while 
making the decision the background knowledge that is either explicitly there or it is in the 
background either we can recognize that, yes he is a knowledgeable man so he can do 
that or even for a common person that in-built knowledge that has come with him with 
evolution in whatever form might be that plays a role and tells the decision maker what to 
do that may be in the biological system as such and based on that the action is taken. So 
we can see from here that knowledge certainly have a role in demonstrating intelligent 
behavior because if we cut this part off then we will be able to sense but we will not be 
able to say what to do, we will not be able to act properly.  
 
The fact that we act properly tells us we have knowledge in some form which tells us 
how to act given a particular scenario in the environment. That is the basic background of 
knowledge and intelligence. Therefore here you see that this knowledge certainly plays a 
very important part. But the question is our decision maker when we are starting 
Artificial Intelligence our objective is to build machine that will be able to behave like a 
human being or at least demonstrate some intelligent behavior.  
 
Therefore, it is necessary for human beings we may or may not know exactly how 
knowledge has been incorporated in the brain. But in order to build a machine that will 
act intelligently it is mandatory that we must have a means of representing knowledge. 
How to represent knowledge? How to represent knowledge in a way that a machine can 
understand is all that we are going to learn in this lecture and the subsequent lectures in 
this module.  
 
Knowledge representation:  
How can we represent knowledge in a machine?  
Now, in order to represent express anything that we want to talk about we need a 
language. So, just for expressing the knowledge we also need to have a language that will 
be able to represent the domain knowledge. The word domain is underlined because 
knowledge is not a small thing; it is very difficult to have a complete knowledge of 
everything. Even for a small problem solving activity, for example geometry, the amount 
of knowledge besides the theorems the intuition that this theorem can be applied at this 
point of time is also a part of knowledge. Now all these are really vast. Hence we should 
try to first capture or first focus on a particular domain and try to represent the knowledge 
about that domain.  
 
We can only expect a machine to demonstrate an intelligent behavior when that machine 
is left to work in a particular environment in a particular domain provided we empower 
the machine with the relevant knowledge of that domain. Let us take the example of the 
theorems in the case of geometry, a theorem is just an expression and that takes help of 
the language English as well as the basic definitions, names, vocabulary of the domain 
geometry. So we always need a language. Algebra for example is a language of 
expression. We can very succinctly express many things in algebraic equation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:38) 
 
 
 
Similarly, for representing knowledge we need to take the help of some language. 
Suppose there is some language that has represented some knowledge, now what is the 
use of that knowledge? Unless there is somebody who can take the help of this 
knowledge who can understand the language in which the knowledge has been expressed 
and therefore can use it the knowledge is of no significance. Hence we must first have a 
language no doubt about it but also there must be a method that will be able to use this 
knowledge.  
 
If we think of knowledge representation we must think about the things, one is the 
language another is a viable method that can be executed in a machine so that it can read 
the language, understand the language and act according to the knowledge that is 
expressed in that language. This method is used to interpret knowledge in response to an 
environmental fact that has been sensed.  
 
Remember we discussed earlier, we sense from the environment, first you have to sense 
and then you have to use the knowledge to act accordingly. That entire thing is clubbed in 
the name inference machine. So an inference machine or inference mechanism what it 
does is, it reads the environment, can interpret the knowledge that has been represented in 
a suitable language and use that knowledge to act according to the need. Therefore it can 
generate proper actions which we often say that the machine or object is behaving 
intelligently.  
 
So, in order to demonstrate intelligent behavior specifically two things are needed. One is 
the knowledge represented in some language and the method to use the language in all 
we must have a powerful inference machine that can understand the language in which 
knowledge has been represented. So a knowledge representation should include both; the 
language to represent knowledge and an inference mechanism that can use this 
knowledge. These two together when defined gives us a knowledge representation 
scheme. Whenever we talk of any language we talk about grammar, some rules that the 
language must follow because unless the language is grammatically well formed, it is 
grammatically correct it will be difficult for others to understand it. We can take the 
example of our normal day to day English, if we say a wrong English statement then 
many people will not be able to understand it, some may be able to apply their own 
knowledge and still understand it.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:15)  
 
 
 
But for a computer or for a machine the scenario is little different because here a machine 
can play with the things that it knows it cannot as yet interpret in any particular way. So 
we must stick to the grammar the syntax of the language so that the inference machine 
which is nothing but a machine which is a program running in a computer will be able to 
understand what it says. So the syntax is the grammar of any language and semantics of a 
language is the meaning.  
 
For example, I say pen cut road cut is a verb; pen is a noun and road is also a noun, but 
all these together do not really convey anything meaningful to you although everything 
was there. Here I have made a syntactic mistake, even if it is syntactically correct I 
should have said that the pen cuts the road. Now does it really mean anything? Can you 
really map this to a real world scenario? Have you ever seen a pen cutting the road? So 
the semantics is an issue, does it carry the meaning?  
So two things are important; one is the syntax, one is the semantics. Both of them must 
be well defined in order to form a knowledge representation language. For example, if 
you write laughs tom. Now laughs then parenthesis tom. What does it mean? Does it 
mean tom laughs? Does it mean tom is laughed at? What does it mean? Assuming that 
this is the correct syntax in some language what is the meaning of that, what is the 
semantics of this? We must understand this. For example, likes (Sunita, Aditi) now what 
does it mean? Sunita likes Aditi or Aditi likes Sunita? There must be a specific 
interpretation that should be given in order that this statement like (Sunita, Aditi) can 
qualify as a value knowledge representation language.  
 
When we are talking of language we must search for a language and logic is one such 
formal language. Let us start with propositional logic because propositional logic is a 
relatively simpler form of logic. Anything that we use in our day to day world is a 
proposition. Now I make a statement Anil is intelligent. It is a statement, it is a 
proposition. Anil is hard working, it is another proposition. I am making a statement 
about Anil, Anil is hard working. So both these are propositions. So Anil is intelligent is 
a proposition, Anil is hardworking is a proposition. Again if I make a statement like, if 
Anil is intelligent and Anil is hard working then Anil scores high marks. This is also 
proposition because I am making another statement.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:21)  
 
 
 
But this statement is a combination of some other propositions. Anil is intelligent is a 
proposition and this one says, if Anil is intelligent and Anil is hardworking this Anil is 
hardworking is itself a proposition here, then Anil scores high marks, so all these white 
ones are also individual propositions. But when I am connecting all this together I am 
making another proposition. This one is called compound proposition. So briefly 
speaking whenever we speak in our day to day life, whatever statements we make 
consists of propositions. Now these propositions Anil is intelligent, Anil is hardworking 
are constituted of objects and relations or functions. Now, the statement, Anil is 
intelligent can be true or false. Anil is hardworking can be true or can be false.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:59) 
 
 
 
Therefore any proposition in propositional logic can have either of two values true or 
false. And it is constituted of objects and relations or functions. So Anil is an object, 
hardworking, intelligent are some functions or relations depending on the usage. So, 
when we write intelligent on Anil I am putting in some function on Anil and that means 
Anil is intelligent and this entire thing can be true if the Anil that I am taking about is 
true, is intelligent if that Anil is intelligent then this statement is true. Hardworking Anil 
again means Anil is hardworking. So again these are propositions. Now, propositions can 
be written either in this way or intelligent Anil I could have also written in that way 
provided my language the syntax of the language are allowed. A proposition can be true 
or false. Now let us look at it a little more formally. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:04)  
 
 
 
Can I write it in any particular way or the way I like?  
For example, intelligent Anil or intelligent Anil within parenthesis or what should I 
write? We must come to the syntax in order to know that. And syntax basically talks 
about the grammar of the sentence. Now, let P stand for this proposition that I was using 
intelligent Anil. Let Q stand for hardworking Anil. Now look at this symbol this is a 
logical n.  
 
What does P AND Q mean?  
P AND Q is a new proposition. Now P AND Q is true when P is true and Q is true that is 
when both of them are true. If either of them is false then P AND Q is not true. But P 
AND Q is another proposition, although P is true Q is false, P AND Q both will be false. 
Or when P is true and Q is true I will have to separately evaluate P AND Q and see that P 
AND Q is true. This symbol means P OR Q. 
 
What does P OR Q mean?  
This is again another proposition P OR Q. this means that when either P is true or Q is 
true any one of them is true then this proposition P OR Q will be true. So P OR Q are 
examples of compound propositions because P is a proposition statement, Q is a 
statement. I have formed a new statement by applying some connection operators like 
AND OR etc. There are other operators also which you can use to make more compound 
statements. Now let us look at it in a more formal manner. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:00) 
 
 
 
Syntactic Elements of Propositional Logic:  
Any language will have some vocabulary. For example, the language English for that we 
have got the vowels, consonants, some numbers etc. Similarly, for propositional logic 
also the vocabulary is a set of propositional symbols. Now whether Anil is intelligent or 
Anil is hardworking, Geetha is beautiful, Sita is smart etc we can symbolically represent 
each of these propositions as P, Q, R etc. So let us symbolically represent P, Q, R which 
is a set of propositional symbols.  
 
There should be a set of propositional symbols and as we have seen any proposition can 
be either true or false. Each of these P, Q, R can be true or false. Besides there will be a 
set of logical operations. Why do you say it is logical operator? It is because this operator 
can have either true value or false value. After I apply a logical operator on two variables 
P and Q I will get P AND Q that will return a value true or false. That is the significance 
of logical operator.  
 
Now we can have AND OR NOT and implies these are the basic four logical operators 
that are used in propositional logic. Often parenthesis is also used for grouping. There are 
two special symbols true and false. Basically these are logical constants. Any proposition 
can have the value true or false. Therefore both these true or false are very important 
logical constants you will be using all through.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:02)  
 
 
 
Basically we have seen that there are four basic operators besides parenthesis AND OR 
NOT and implies. Now we will see the meaning of those but before that we will see how 
to form propositional sentences. We have got the vocabulary which is set of propositional 
symbols, we have got the logical operators and we have got the logical constants like true 
or false. So let us see how we can form logical sentences using these. Each symbol 
whether it is a proposition or a constant is a sentence, it is always the sentence. If P is a 
sentence and Q is a sentence then if we block them in parenthesis, parenthesis P is a 
symbol. Since P is a sentence and Q is a sentence P AND Q is a sentence.  
 
Similarly, P OR Q is a sentence. If P is a sentence NOT P is also a sentence. For 
example, if we say Anil is good which is P then NOT P is NOT Anil is good. Anil is 
good was true and NOT of Anil is good will be false. But NOT of Anil is good is also a 
valid sentence. It may evaluate to true or may evaluate to false. P implies Q is also a 
sentence, nothing else is a sentence. This is very important, that, in order to qualify as a 
valid propositional sentence each of these statements that are formed, where P is a 
sentence and Q is a sentence now I can comply with these only if these allowed are ways. 
Either I block them bracket them in the parenthesis then it is a valid sentence, P AND Q 
will be a sentence, P OR Q will also be a sentence, NOT P is a sentence, P implies Q is a 
sentence and nothing else is a sentence.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:31)  
 
 
 
Often you will see that sentences are also called well formed formulae written in short 
wff. We will use the term sentence or well formed formulae interchangeably. Here are 
some examples of wff well formed formulae: P S is a well formed formulae, true is a 
logical constant so it is a well formed formulae, P AND Q uses allowed operator so it is a 
well formed formulae.  
 
Now let us look at P OR Q implies R so P OR Q is a valid proposition and any valid 
proposition P implies R is a valid proposition so this whole thing implies R is a valid 
proposition so this is a valid sentence. P AND Q OR R implies S is a valid sentence. 
Now, NOT of P OR Q here I see that P is a proposition or a sentence, Q is a proposition 
or sentence, if P is a valid sentence, Q is a valid sentence therefore P OR Q is also valid 
sentence. Since this is a valid sentence if I apply the NOT operator over there that is also 
a valid sentence. Similarly here you see that NOT of P OR Q implies R AND S is also 
valid sentence.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:22) 
 
 
 
There is a special meaning of this implication statement we are talking of. What does 
implication mean?  
When we say X implies Y or P implies Q that means if P is true then Q is true. P implies 
Q when P is true then Q is true. But not the other way round. It tells of a sufficient 
condition. If P is true then Q will certainly be true. For example, if it rains then the roads 
are wet. So, it rains, that is my P and the roads are wet that is Q. So if it rains, that is if it 
rains is true then the roads are wet. But if you say if the roads are wet then it rains now is 
it an implication because if the roads are wet can I always infer that it rains because the 
roads can be wet because of some other reason also. There might be a sprinkler that has 
been used to clean the road or the road has been washed it did not rain. So roads are wet 
is not a sufficient condition to say that it rains. So, in the case of implication when we 
write P implies Q that means if P is true then Q is true but Q can be true even if P is false. 
Now this is a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition.  
 
Equivalence is a bi junction that means for example it is a bidirectional statement. If P is 
true then Q is true and again if Q is true then also you can infer that P is true. Now, here 
let us try with an example: If two sides of a triangle are equal then two base angles of the 
triangle are equal. Now we know from our knowledge of geometry two sides of a triangle 
are equal then that is an isosceles triangle and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are 
equal. So if I had stated it in a different way that if two base angles of a triangle are equal 
then the two sides of the triangle are equal that will be true also. Therefore in that case if I 
say two sides of a triangle are equal that is P and two base angles of a triangle are equal 
that is Q then I could have said P implies Q and Q implies P.  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 36:01) 
 
 
 
Equivalence can be expressed using two sentences P implies Q, Q implies P. In 
propositional logic equivalence is not a necessary operator. We have seen that along with 
AND OR NOT. We had implies operator and with implies operator with two sentences 
giving both directions of implication we can capture equivalence. So we can have P 
implies Q and Q implies P. Next is a very important issue.  
 
With this brief discussion on syntax let us come to the semantics the meaning of a 
propositional sentence. When we try to understand a sentence essentially what we do is 
we interpret that sentence. We try to understand each of the propositions and try to see 
whether that is true or false and then we make a decision on the whole. So, if there be a 
sentence P we must first interpret what does that P mean, Anil is intelligent what is the 
meaning of intelligent? What is Anil? All these are nothing but symbolic labels. That is, 
we interpret in a particular world. When we interpret a sentence in a particular world the 
world can be the world of football match, world of cricket match, the world of picnic, the 
world of class room all these things are different worlds and each of these worlds have 
got some known relations some known functions and there are some interpretations we 
give in a particular world. What is true in this world may not be true in another world. 
The rule of a baseball match is different from the rule of a cricket match.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:07) 
 
 
 
So the cricket match along with all its rules, all its definitions and all these things form a 
world. Similarly a soccer match or a baseball match forms a different world. So when we 
interpret a sentence in a world we assign meaning to it and that evaluates to true or false. 
For example, let us start with a proposition P and suppose that proposition means a child 
can write that is a proposition. So this proposition P is a level for the child can write. And 
suppose here we have got a world nursery and there is another world class two, now what 
is the truth value of this statement the child can write?  
When I interpret it in this world nursery probably it evaluates as false because suppose 
the children in the nursery cannot write. But again when I interpret it in the world of class 
two then it evaluates to true. The same proposition P can be interpreted in two different 
worlds in two different ways.  
 
Again suppose this P is now interpreted as another statement the child can speak now the 
child can speak is an interpretation of P but again that one when I interpret to the world 
nursery that should evaluate to true, again that thing when interpreted in the world of 
class two that is true. Therefore this statement P can have value true or false depending 
on its interpretation.  
 
When I interpret P as the child can write and that is interpreted in the world nursery then 
it evaluates to false. But when this is interpreted in the world class two then it evaluates 
to true. Now when P is interpreted to the child can speak that can evaluate to true when 
interpreted in this world. The statement, when interpreted in a particular world, is very 
important to note. And this interpretation itself attributes the meaning or the semantics to 
the proposition. We will see a couple of more examples.  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 40:19) 
 
 
 
Here is another example P; now P says Ram is intelligent, P is leveled as Ram is 
intelligent and Q is another statement which is saying Gita is diligent. Now you can say 
that there is some hidden interpretation here; P: Ram is intelligent. Which Ram I am 
talking about? I must be meaning some Ram which is constant and that is the subject to 
the way I have interpreted it.  
 
Then I will again look at class 2 and there is class 3 and there is a Ram in class 3 who is 
intelligent. Then, this, ‘Ram is intelligent’ evaluates to true and might be Gita is diligent, 
that is talking about new proposition, Gita is diligent is false. When I talk about Gita, 
Gita studies in class 2, but Ram is intelligent, also, there is another Ram in class 2 and 
that Ram is not that intelligent so that evaluates to false.  
 
Similarly Gita is diligent and that evaluated to true for Gita who was in class 2 but if I 
interpret for Gita who is in class 3 she is also intelligent so both of them are intelligent. 
Here we will be dealing with these two symbols P and Q. Now whether P is true or P is 
false Q is true or Q is false is totally dependent on the way we interpret it in a particular 
world. These are the two examples of worlds we are talking of. So how do you get the 
meaning of it? Remember that sentences can be compound propositions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 42:05)  
 
 
 
We have seen that P is a sentence; Q is a sentence now we can connect them in different 
ways and thereby we can get different compound statements. So sentences can be 
compound propositions. For that, in order to understand the meaning of the sentence we 
have to interpret each individual atomic proposition in the same world and that is 
important. And unless we interpret it in the same world it will not be really meaningful. 
So the first step is, we interpret each atomic proposition in the same world and assign 
truth values to each of the atomic interpretations. We take atomic propositions we assign 
truth values to the interpretation of each of the atomic propositions and compute the truth 
value of the compound proposition.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 44:01) 
 
 
Therefore there are three steps: We interpret each atomic proposition, assign truth values 
to each interpretation and then compute the truth value of the compound proposition.  
 
Examples: P is a proposition that is actually meaning likes( Sumit, Sunil). My 
interpretation is that Sumit likes Sunil and Q is knows (Jyoti, Sudhir) that means Jyoti 
knows Sudhir. Suppose Sumit likes Sunil is my syntactic aspect now the world that we 
are talking of is that Sumit and Sunil are friends and Jyoti and Sudhir are known to each 
other. Then what will happen? Sumit and Sunil are friends so obviously friends like each 
other so this one will evaluate to true and Jyoti and Sudhir are also known to each other 
so this is also true in that world. But might be Gita and Sudhir do not know each other so 
the proposition knows Gita Sudhir will evaluate to false. But knows (Jyoti, Sudhir) 
evaluates to true.  
 
Here we see that P evaluates to true and Q also evaluates to true. Therefore in this case P 
AND Q is true because both of them are correct. But what happens to P AND NOT Q? 
Here Q was true and here NOT of Q means knows (Jyoti, Sudhir). I negate that which 
means does not know (Jyoti, Sudhir). But Jyoti and Sudhir know each other so knows 
(Jyoti, Sudhir) is true and the statement does not know (Jyoti, Sudhir) is false.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 46:24)  
 
 
 
Here the world we are talking about plays a very important role because the truth value of 
this proposition would have varied depending on the world in which you are interpreting. 
Here you find P AND Q is true but now NOT Q means that this part which was true in 
this world NOT Q is false in the same world. So now this is false P is true so P AND 
NOT Q is false. We have seen the world part. Now there is a very important concept 
validity of a sentence.  
 
Often you say this is valid this is invalid but in the case of logic this validity is a very 
important notion and we must try to understand that. A propositional sentence is said to 
be valid if under all possible interpretations it is true. If a proposition sentence is true 
under all possible interpretations then it is called valid. So, irrespective of the world in 
which we interpret it if the propositional sentence always evaluates to true then it is a 
valid proposition. There are other definitions like satisfiability which we will look into 
later. Therefore whenever a proposition is evaluated to true in a particular world then that 
is satisfied by that world but it is not a valid statement. When we say a particular 
statement is valid then it will be true irrespective of the world in which I interpret.  
 
Now a typical example is; P OR NOT P. Now P can be true, if P is true then NOT P will 
be false. But we know that in OR connector P OR NOT Q in that case if any one of them 
is true it will be true. Now what will happen if P is false?  
If P is false then NOT P will be true so any one of them will ultimately be true always 
irrespective of whatever P means. If P means Gita is intelligent, Sita is diligent etc 
whatever interpretation you give it does not really matter P OR NOT P will always be 
true for any particular interpretation you give in any particular world. If P is some 
statement from the world of cricket and NOT P is also computed in that particular 
domain then of course P or NOT P either of them will always be true and hence this 
proposition will always be true. Therefore this is known as tautology and tautology is a 
classical example of a valid sentence.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 49:45) 
 
 
 
So once again I repeat, what is a valid sentence?  
A sentence that is true irrespective of interpretation. Before going to the quiz let me once 
again summarize whatever we have looked at. We said at the very beginning that, in 
order to represent knowledge we have to take recourse to a particular language. And any 
language if it has to be very easily and mechanically understood, if it has to be 
understood by machine then it must adhere to a strict syntax and that syntax will be 
interpreted by the machine which will understand its meaning.  
 
We also said that, knowledge is important in order to exhibit intelligent behavior because 
whenever we sense something from the world we have to act according to it. Now, in 
order to act according to it we will have to sense it but just merely sensing will not do but 
we will also have to act according to it and how do you know how to act? For that we 
will have to have some knowledge that will be accumulated and kept.  
 
Now we may keep the knowledge in some way. But it will be not it will not at all be 
useful unless we use that knowledge. In order to use that knowledge we need an inference 
mechanism which must understand the knowledge and in order that an inference 
mechanism can understand it and can interpret it then it must have a strict syntax 
language structure. And we started with logic and specifically propositional logic which 
is a part of logic. This propositional logic has got a set of vocabulary.  
 
A vocabulary consists of some atomic statements like P, Q, and R each of which we have 
given examples of. Each of them are sentences and there are some rules using which we 
can form compound sentences. We can use AND OR NOT implication and using this we 
will make compound sentences. And the semantics of a particular sentence may be 
compound or simple depends on its interpretation in a particular world. We have shown 
how to interpret it. After interpretation we will find out the truth value of that. Now in the 
next lecture we will see how the actual inferencing is done in case of propositional logic. 
In this lecture we have just introduced you so that you can take it up from here. In the 
meanwhile it will be good to have a couple of these exercises done.

Quiz: Express the following English statements in the language of propositional logic. It 
rains in July. The book is not costly. If it rains today and one does not carry umbrella he 
will be drenched. Some of these will be very easy and some of them will be little 
difficult. We will look at in the next lecture how to solve them. Now you can see, here 
this one is a compound proposition. It will require some compound proposition and these 
are simple propositions. But here again you will need some logical operators.  
 
And the second part is; if P is true and Q is true then are the following true or false? P 
implies Q, so if P is true and Q is true then I am asking whether this entire proposition is 
true or false. NOT P OR Q implies Q, NOT P OR Q implies Q, NOT P, the third one is 
NOT P OR Q implies P, P OR NOT P implies T where T is a logical constant true. In the 
first one what we are showing here is, we want you to first translate these in the language 
of propositional logic. Just follow the syntax and transform them in the language of 
propositional logic. The second one, the book is not costly, if it rains today and one does 
not carry umbrella he will be drenched etc.

In the second assignment here there is a little bit of semantics. When you look at it you 
have to know whether they are evaluating true or false. You have to try to compute the 
truth value for these. In the next lecture we will be talking about inferencing and how we 
will automatically find the truth value of the propositional sentences.

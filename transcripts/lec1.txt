Today we start the lecture on the course Artificial Intelligence. This course will be 
delivered by me Sudeshna Sarkar and Professor Anupam Basu both from the Computer 
Science and engineering department IIT Kharagpur.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:10) 
 
 
 
The goals for this course are to introduce you to the field of Artificial Intelligence. We 
want to explain to you the challenges that are inherent in building a system that can be 
considered to be intelligent. In this course we will be explaining the key paradigms of 
Artificial Intelligence, the core techniques and technologies used and algorithms for some 
of these techniques.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:43) 
 
 
 
The instructional objectives of this course: 
On taking this course you should b able to understand the role of basic knowledge 
representation, how to represent our knowledge about the world and knowledge of 
problem solving techniques and a knowledge of some of the learning methods in AI. And 
we will see how these are used to solve different problems and to build a complete 
intelligent system. 
 
On taking this course you should be able to assess the applicability the strengths and 
weaknesses of these methods of the different techniques that we discuss. We will discuss 
the strengths of this method and situations where these methods can be applied to solve 
different types of problems that require intelligence. You will learn how to develop 
intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:56) 
 
 
 
The way we will do it is, we will look at the different components of intelligence and for 
each of these we will discuss ways of solving these problems. And then, depending on 
the functionality of the system that you wish to construct or engineer you can put together 
some of these solutions to get the full system. After you have taken the scores you should 
be able to appreciate the role of problem solving, the role of natural language processing, 
the role of computer vision etc in understanding human intelligence from a computational 
point of view.  
 
Some more points on objectives of the course:  
On taking this course you should be able to formulate certain types of problems as state 
space search problems and you should learn the efficient methods to solve them 
depending upon the characteristics of the problem space, you should be able to write 
programs that play games particularly two player games, you should be able to use 
learning to find patterns in data to find rules from data, you should be able to build expert 
systems for different diagnostic and other purposes.

Some of the text books we will follow for this course are the two books which I will be 
referring to and professor Basu will also talk about the other books he will refer to. The 
books are Artificial Intelligence a modern approach second edition by Stuart Russell and 
Peter Norwich. This book is published by Prentice Hall and also by Pearson. The second 
book is Artificial Intelligence a new synthesis by Nilsson published by Morgan 
Kaufmann publishers. Today’s lecture will be the first lecture in the series. The first 
module for this course is the introduction and today’s lecture is the first lecture this 
module which is introduction to AI. Now let us come to the objectives of today’s lecture.  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:50) 
 
 
 
The instructional objectives of today’s lecture are:  
To understand the definition of Artificial Intelligence, what Artificial Intelligence is?  
What is it about?  
Secondly we will be discussing the different faculties involved with intelligent behavior, 
the different components that define intelligence. We will also be examining the different 
ways of approaching AI and finally we will also look at some example systems that have 
been constructed, that are popularly known which use AI and lastly we will also take a 
brief look at the history of AI. On taking this lesson you should become familiar with the 
different ways of defining Artificial Intelligence. As we will see different people may 
define AI differently and we will familiarize ourselves with these definitions.  
 
Secondly, as I mentioned, we will try to understand the different components of 
intelligent behavior.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:06) 
 
 
 
Another objective of today’s lecture is also to let you develop an appreciation of the vast 
scope of Artificial Intelligence and the intellectual challenges that are there in the field. 
On talking today’s course you should be able to have a fair idea of the types of problems 
that can be currently solved by the computers and today’s techniques that we know. We 
will also have an idea of those problems that is still difficult or we cannot yet solve it by 
the techniques that we know today.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:54) 
 
 
 
These are four main components of today’s lecture. Definition of AI, example systems, 
approaches to AI and the brief history. First we will take up the definition of AI.  
 
Now, what is Artificial Intelligence?  
There are too many definitions of this term floating around.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:17) 
 
 
 
As you see or what is clear from the two words Artificial Intelligence it is clear to see that 
AI is concerned with the design of intelligence. And in the first term AI is actually 
concerned with design of intelligence in artificial artifacts and artificial devices. Thus, 
artificial systems or man made systems are building intelligence into them. This term was 
coined by McCarthy in 1956 in a famous conference the Dartmouth conference.  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:25) 
 
 
 
Now, the term artificial is easy to understand but what is intelligence?  
It is very difficult to define intelligence. Often we look at some people look at 
intelligence as something that characterizes humans. If you take human beings to be 
intelligent you can say Artificial Intelligence means having behavior which is like a 
human. In fact there are two schools of thought here. Here an idea is to have a machine or 
have a system that behaves like a human. Humans are not always completely intelligent 
even though humans are very good. Actually pretty intelligent but all the time humans do 
not behave intelligently.  
 
So the other school of thought is that Artificial Intelligence concerns with intelligence 
which is the ideal or the best behavior or the most rational behavior. It is the machine that 
should behave in the best possible manner. There is another dichotomy in the definition. 
 
When we talk about behavior what sort of behavior are we talking about?  
There are two main types of behavior that people will like to talk about. Number one is 
thinking, thinking intelligently, reasoning properly and intelligently in order to come up 
with a solution. And the second approach is to talk about not thinking but acting how the 
system actually acts or behaves. We can talk about intelligence as something which 
characterizes humans or something that means behavior in the best possible manner or 
behaving rationally.  
 
Again we can talk about intelligence in thought or intelligence in action. So, based on this 
criterion we can look at the different ways of defining AI. So we may look at thought 
processing or reasoning versus behavior, we may look at human like performance versus 
ideal rational performance. And this diagram shows the four different definitions that 
emerge from these two dichotomous. 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:10) 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:12) 
 
 
 
On the one hand we have thought or reasoning versus behavior and on the other hand we 
have human like performance versus ideal performance. So there are systems that think 
like humans. For example, we will discuss the famous Turing test which was devised by 
Alan Turing where the system which passed the Turing test would be a system that 
behaves like a human or thinks like a human. The second definition is systems that think 
rationally.  
The school of thought were different philosophers, mathematicians and computer 
scientists who have worked on logic and laws of thought believe in this approach. 
Thirdly, there are systems that act like humans. Cognitive scientists look at the properties 
of systems that act like humans and finally we have the definition systems that act 
rationally or systems that act in the best possible manner. And for this we have the 
approach of constructing a rational agent an agent which acts rationally. Alan Turing 
considered by many to be the father of AI devised the Turing test.  
 
In the Turing test this is the experimental set up that is devised. There will be a closed 
room and in this closed room there will be a being which may be a computer and it may 
be a human. There is an interrogator outside the room. The interrogator does not know 
whether the being inside the room is a computer or a human. So what the interrogator 
does is that the interrogator asks questions and the being inside the room processes these 
questions and returns some answer and the interrogator on the left room receives the 
answers on the screen.  
 
Now the interrogator has to make out from the answers whether the being inside the room 
is a computer or human. Now, if there is a computer inside the room the computer tries to 
convince the interrogator that it is actually a human being in the way it answers to the 
questions and it is the task of the interrogator to decide who is human.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:30) 
 
 
 
This is a schematic diagram of the Turing test, this is the interrogator sitting in front of 
the terminal, this is a wall room. The wall room may contain either a human or a 
computer and the interrogator has to decide whether what is inside is a computer or a 
human being.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:51) 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:59) 
 
 
 
Now, if the interrogator cannot reliably distinguish between a human answerer and a 
computer answerer then we can say that the computer system possesses Artificial 
Intelligence. This is the test devised by Turing to find out whether the machine has been 
able to come up with a right amount of intelligence to match human intelligence in 
answering questions. Now let us look at typical AI problems.  
 
Intelligent entities or agents need to be able to do different types of tasks. There are some 
tasks which are mundane tasks that we do as a matter of fact in out daily life and there are 
some tasks that we consider intelligent like solving difficult mathematical problems, 
playing games of chess in an expert fashion and other activities which intelligent people 
can do well. Now, examples of mundane tasks are planning route. Suppose you want to 
go to here from the market and you plan a path along which you will go. Or you want to 
go from here to let us a say a particular place in Delhi and you have to plan your journey 
and plan your path. Something that we do all the time is trying to recognize objects or 
recognize faces of people, this requires vision.  
 
Thirdly, we communicate with each other through natural language. Fourthly, we 
navigate around obstacles on the street. So these are the tasks that we do routinely. In fact 
most animals do this task routinely. And then there are expert tasks like medical 
diagnosis which are only the doctor or the expert in the field does. And mathematical 
problem solving can be done effectively only by good mathematicians.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:31) 
 
 
 
Now which of these problems are easy for the computer to do and which of these 
problems are hard. Surprisingly it has been much easier to mechanize many of the high 
level tasks which are so called expert tasks which has been easier in the history of AI and 
the history of computers. It has been easier to solve problems which are really the domain 
of experts but AI has not had the same amount of success in dealing with mundane tasks.  
 
For example, AI systems can easily do symbolic integration. Some of the systems can 
prove some theorems. AI systems can play chess quite well. There are systems “ “ 
diagnosis in particular domains. However, there are certain things that humans and 
animals do quite effortlessly.  
 
For example, walking around without running into things catching prey and avoiding 
predators, interpreting complex sensory information, modeling the internal states of other 
animals trying to understand what they are thinking about us and how to plan what to say 
and so on and also working as a team or collaborating.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:03) 
 
 
 
Then these tasks unfortunately have not all been easy to do by machines. Let us look at 
some of the basic intelligent behavior in human beings. Perception that is the ability to 
see, hear sensory information.  
 
Reasoning: Reasoning with the information that we have.  
 
Learning: Learning for new situations, understanding natural language, communicating in 
natural language, solving problems.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:50) 
 
 
 
Hence these things namely perception, reasoning, learning, language, understanding and 
solving problems are examples of some of the things that we want our AI systems to 
solve. Having looked at the definition of AI let us have a look at some examples of AI 
systems that have been around.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:26) 
 
 
 
These are some of the applications of AI:  
Computer vision, image recognition including face recognition, robotics, natural 
language processing and natural language understanding, speech processing, etc. Then if 
you look the practical impact of AI the AI components are embedded in numerous 
devices. Even in some copy machines there are AI components embedded. AI systems 
are in everyday use in detecting credit card fraud, in configuring products, in complex 
planning tasks, in advising physicians. Then intelligent tutoring systems provide students 
with personalized attention. These systems are there being used and they have a 
tremendous impact because they are so useful.

This is a system ALVINN which stands for Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural 
Network. It was designed in 1989 by Dean Pomerleau at Carnegie Mellon University. 
This system drove a car from the east coast to the west coast across United States of 
America using computer control. And it drove completely autonomously for most of the 
2850 miles. Only for 50 miles especially at exits to freeways etc the human driver took 
charge. For 2800 miles the car drove it. And the idea behind the car is quite simple. In 
front of the car is a camera which takes a picture of the road in front.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:55) 
 
 
 
And this picture or this image is used in a neural network. This picture is captured into an 
image having 30/32 pixels. These pixels are fed into a neural network four hidden units 
and the output tells the processor which way to turn the wheel and decide the speed and 
so on. In 1997 the deep blue chess program developed at IBM be it the current world 
chess champion Gary Kasparov. This is the computer deep blue and this is Gary 
Kasparov after he lost the match accidentally.

In a machine translation if we could have immediate translations between people 
speaking different languages that would be a remarkable feat and it has very wide ranging 
economic and cultural implications. In the world today there are people speaking so many 
different languages and we do not understand the languages of many other people. Even 
in India as you know there are so many languages, there are more than 20 official 
languages and I cannot understand the language of each Indian. So would it not it be nice 
if we had a system which would do simultaneous machine translations so that we can 
effortlessly understand each other.  
 
Full machine translation is not yet there but there has been quite some progress in the 
field of machine translation in a small way. For example, the US military is giving a 
simpler one way translation device they are using this in Iraq. US forces are using the 
Phraselator to communicate with injured Iraqi prisoners of war travelers at checkpoints 
and for other peace keeping duties. Carnegie Mellon University is working on a system 
called the speechlator for use in doctor patient interview.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:29) 
 
 
 
Imagine how difficult it is when a doctor does not understand the language of the patient. 
And when the patient does not understand the language of the doctor the patient will not 
be able to communicate his symptoms to the doctor. So speechlator is used in order to 
help doctors do so. In space exploration robotic space probes autonomously monitor their 
surroundings, make decisions and act to achieve their goals. This is the homepage of 
Mars Exploration Rover Mission.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:35) 
 
 
 
If you have a look at this page hosted by jet propulsion laboratory this page brings us live 
the explorations that are being carried on by the Mars Rover. There are two Mars Rovers 
spirit and opportunity that have been sent to Mars. They have already finished their 
primary assignments and are continuing with exploratory duties. These two pages contain 
updates of spirit and this page contains the update of opportunity.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:32) 
 
 
 
For example, let me read for you an excerpt from the spirit update. Just a little RAT, 
Spirit spent the last few salts investigating pot of gold including a successful grind with 
the Rock Abrasion Tool that is what RAT is, a RAT is a Rock Abrasion Tool. So, what 
spirit is doing is using a rock abrasion tool and getting samples of rocks from the surface 
of Mars and it is trying to find out what chemicals are present in the rock. So, one of the 
objectives of this mission is to find out whether there is water in Mars.  
 
In fact these Mars Rovers have been able to trace the presence of water from the rock 
samples in Mars. Then opportunity is going from Virginia to London. These are different 
locations defined on the mars’ surface and opportunity is currently in a crater called the 
endurance crater and it is abrading and examining rocks. This image shows the area 
inside endurance crater that opportunity has been examining. The Rover is investigating 
the distinct layers of rock that make up this region. And this image taken by Rover 
highlights the nodular nuggets that cover the rock that has been named the Pot of Gold. 
These nuggets appear to stand on the end of stalk like features.  
 
The surface of the rock is dotted with fine scale pits. And there are so many other news 
about these two Space rovers. The Spirit rover is currently exploring a range of marsh 
and hills that took two months to reach. It is finding curiously eroding rocks that may be 
new pieces to the puzzle of the region’s past. Spirit’s twin opportunity is also negotiating 
sloped ground examining exposed rock layers inside a crater informally named 
endurance.

We have intelligent agents that are going to unknown territory where no human has been 
before and they are carrying on explorations and making new inferences.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:29) 
 
 
 
Then there are internet agents. All of you are familiar with the explosive growth of the 
internet in recent years and there is a growing interest in internet agents that can monitor 
users’ tasks, seek information that is needed from the web and learn which information is 
most useful for a particular user. Now that we have looked at different examples of 
systems that use Artificial Intelligence we will briefly look at some approaches to AI and 
some approaches to solving AI tasks. One way of looking at AI is strong AI or weak AI. 
Strong AI aims to build machines that can truly reason and solve problems. Strong AI are 
machines that are self aware and whose overall intellectual ability is indistinguishable 
from that of a human being.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:54) 
 
 
 
So strong AI proponents want to develop systems that are completely intelligent and that 
can do things fully using their own intelligence. Such systems can be human like can be 
non-human-like but rational. When AI was conceived in the 1950s and 1960s there was a 
huge optimism about AI and there was a prediction that very soon AI systems will be 
able to overtake humans and able to everything that a human can do and can do them 
much better and do tasks that humans cannot do within a short time.  
 
However, such optimism has been ill founded and this was partly the reason why some 
people lost faith in the techniques of AI. But now after research into AI has taken place 
for over 50 years now we are in a position to understand and appreciate the true difficulty 
of the different problems that AI face. And we known what we can aim to solve now and 
what is more difficult and we will need different techniques, different hardware and 
different paradigms to be able to solve.  
 
Weak AI unlike strong AI deals with the creation of some Artificial Intelligence that 
cannot truly reason and solve problems but act as if it were intelligent. So the proponents 
of weak AI claim that machines which have been suitably programmed can simulate 
human cognition, appear to behave intelligently, appear to do tasks well and intelligently 
without really having the same intelligence or understanding as humans possess. 
Therefore, strong AI really deals with machines that really have mental states that think, 
reason, understand their behavior whereas weak AI is involved in simulating human 
behavior or simulating intelligent behavior without really claiming that the reasoning 
process behind it is intelligent.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:45) 
 
 
 
The goal of applied AI is to produce viable smart systems. For example, it will be nice to 
have a security system that is able to recognize the faces of people who are permitted to 
enter a particular building. There are certain applications which are useful to us and 
applied AI aims to solve these applications intelligently, not necessarily to construct a 
complete intelligent agent but an agent which is intelligent in doing a specific task. 
 
For example, recognize people, detect credit card fraud, drive a vehicle autonomously. So 
they take up specific tasks and develop systems that solve those tasks. Fourthly, cognitive 
AI deals with the studies where computers are used to test theories about how the human 
mind works. Cognitive scientists want to understand how humans act, how humans 
behave, how humans think and these theories can be tested by building these theories into 
machines and watching and testing how well the machines function using those theories. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:49) 
 
 
 
For example, one may have a theory about how humans recognize faces. We do not know 
how we recognize faces, how our brain recognizes faces, how we store all the different 
faces or some of the many different faces that we have seen in our lifetime and how we 
look at a person and recognize them. So, cognitive scientists have come up with different 
theories about how people recognize faces or how people solve different types of 
problems. And some of these theories can be tested by building similar mechanisms 
which are machine and testing how well the machines perform. Here I have outlined 
some of the topics of AI.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:37) 
 
 
 
In the core areas we talked about knowledge representation, reasoning, machine learning. 
General algorithms: search, planning, constraint, satisfaction.  
 
Perception: vision, natural language processing, robotics.  
Applications: game playing, AI and education, distributed agents.  
Uncertainty: probabilistic approaches, decision theory, reasoning with symbolic data. 
These are some of the topic that people study in AI and in this course also we are going 
to study most of these topics. Today successful AI systems operate in well defined 
specific domains employing narrow or specialized knowledge.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 39:55) 
 
 
 
However, if you want to artifact a system that has general intelligence that can work 
intelligently in any domain we need to have a lot of things. For example, such a system 
must have common sense knowledge which is needed to function in open ended worlds. 
We use such a huge amount of common sense knowledge or background knowledge to 
do our tasks well. If we really start thinking and try to note them down then it is a huge 
effort. There is an effort at Stanford University by Tog Lenat Guha and others called the 
psyche project whose objective is to document all common sense knowledge so that one 
can have a system that can use all these common sense knowledge for their reasoning.  
 
Secondly, a general unconstrained AI system must be able to understand natural 
language, in fact unconstrained natural language. Though there has been a lot of stride in 
natural language understanding, then understanding unconstrained natural language in 
general is a very difficult problem which will require a lot of expertise to solve 
completely.  
 
What can today’s AI systems do?  
We have systems that can recognize faces, we have almost autonomous vehicles, our 
natural language processing systems can do simple machine translation. Our expert 
systems can do medical diagnosis in a narrow domain.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 42:01) 
 
 
 
Our spoken language systems are capable of thousand word continuous speech. Planning 
and scheduling systems are used in Hubble telescope experiments. Hubble telescope is 
one of the most well known telescopes which have been around for several years. Now 
there is a talk of dismantling the Hubble telescope because it has become quite old and 
the cost of maintaining it has become huge. But it is for a long time the Hubble telescope 
has been the most important telescope for gathering a lot of data and there are so many 
people who want to use the Hubble telescope. There is a complex planning and 
scheduling problem to schedule these tasks on the telescope which has been done by AI 
systems.  
 
In learning our text categorization systems can work and categorize the text at about 
thousand topics. In games AI system has achieved grand master level in chess where the 
noise…world champions we have good programs playing checkers.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 43:22) 
 
 
 
But there are many limitations to what AI cannot do yet. AI systems currently cannot 
understand natural language robustly. AI systems cannot surf the web yet or interpret an 
arbitrary visual scene. We have seen that they can recognize facial images or work in a 
narrow domain of recognition. AI systems cannot fully learn a natural language. They 
cannot construct plans in all sorts of dynamic real time domains in general. And AI 
systems do not yet exhibit true autonomy and intelligence.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 44:05) 
  
 
 
Now that we have looked at some of the approaches of AI and what AI can do and not do 
at present let us have a look at the brief history of Artificial Intelligence. The dream of 
making a computer imitate us began many centuries ago. Intellectual roots of AI stretch 
back thousands of years into the earliest studies of nature of knowledge and the nature of 
reasoning.

The concept of intelligent machines is found in Greek mythology. In 8th century 
Pygmalion is credited to have asked the goddess and obtained an ivory statue of a woman 
built after the fashion that he liked.

Hephaestus created a huge robot Talos to guard Crete. So this robot used to go around the 
island of Crete hurling stones at invaders and to detract invaders and if found an 
opponent it would squeeze him to death. Artificial Intelligence draws from many areas 
from philosophy, from mathematics, from economics, biology, and psychology and from 
computer engineering and also from linguistics.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 46:14) 
 
 
 
Philosophers have analyzed the nature of knowledge and have explored formal 
frameworks for developing conclusions. There have been mathematical formalizations in 
logic, in computation and probability. Economists have developed decision theory and 
biologists have reasoned about how the brain processes information. Psychologists have 
long studied human cognition and they require knowledge about the nature of human 
intelligence.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 47:02) 
 
 
 
And finally we want to know how to build an efficient computer. So, in the ancient days 
Aristotle in the 4th century B.C. developed an informal system of logic which was the 
first formal deductive reasoning system. 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 47:26) 
 
 
 
In the 13th century we have Ramon Lull a Spanish theologian who invented the idea of a 
machine that would produce all knowledge by putting together words at random. He even 
tried to build such a machine as concept wheel.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 47:43) 
 
 
 
Then early in the 17th century Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing 
more than complex machines.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 47:54) 
 
 
 
Blaise Pascal in 1642 built the first mechanical digital calculating machine. Leibniz in 
1673 improved Pascal’s machine. 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 48:05) 
 
 
 
So that was the first step in building a mechanical computing device. In 19th century 
George Boole developed a binary algebra representation which laid the foundation of 
Boolean algebra. Charles Babbage and Lady Ada Byron worked on programmable 
mechanical calculating machines.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 48:37) 
 
 
 
In the late 19th century and the early 20th century mathematical philosophers like Gottlob 
Frege, Bertram Russell, Alfred Whitehead and Kurt Gödel built on Boole’s initial logic 
concepts to develop mathematical representations of logic problems.

to study intelligence.

In 1943 McCulloch and Pitts built a Boolean circuit model of the brain. A Logical 
Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity was published and it explained for the 
first time how it is possible for neural networks to compute.

We have already seen Alan Turing. In 1950 Turing published his computing machinery 
and intelligence and this article articulated a complete vision of AI of solving problems, 
how AI systems can solve problems by searching through a space of possible solutions 
guided by heuristics.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 50:09) 
 
 
 
He illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to chess. He propounded the 
possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions so that machines can learn 
from experience. In 1952 to 56 Samuel designed a checkers playing program. In 1956 
Allen Newell and Albert Simon designed the logic theorist. Then the general problem 
solver was built by the same people. In 1959 Gelernter developed the geometry engine 
for solving plane geometry problems.

In 1956 a meeting was held in Dartmouth where the first researchers in AI met. And in 
this month long meeting the term Artificial Intelligence was adopted. This conference 
brought together the founding fathers of AI for the first time. In 1961 James Slagle wrote 
the first symbolic integration program. This program saint could solve calculus problems 
at the college freshman level. In 1963 Thomas Evan’s program analogy was designed, it 
could solve IQ test problems. In 1963 Feigenbaum and Feldman wrote a collection of 
important articles about AI.

Then we have Danny Bobrow in 64 who worked with algebra word problems and in 1965 
Allen Robinson developed a resolution method. In 1966 to 74 there was a lot of work on 
computational complexity by not really AI researchers but by computer theorists which 
had a tremendous impact on the field of AI.

Before that people felt that a lot of things were possible by AI and we will soon have an 
extremely intelligent computer. But the limitations to the computational power was 
discovered when computational complexity was understood. In 1967 Feigenbaum and 
others developed a general program which was demonstrated used to demonstrate and 
interpret mass spectrum on organic chemical compounds.  
 
In 1968 there was a very significant paper by Minsky and Papert which demonstrated the 
limits of simple neural net. This paper had a tremendous negative effect in discouraging 
the field of neural network for the time being. And later of course people realized that 
there are ways of coming out of this problem. In 1969 SRI robot, Shakey in Stanford 
demonstrated locomotion perception and problem solving.

In 1969 to 79 knowledge based systems were developed. In 1976 Doug Lenat handled the 
program called AM and Heurisko demonstrated the discovery model. In 1978 Herbert 
Simon from CMU won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his theory of bounded 
rationality.

In 1980 lisp machines were developed and marketed. In 1985 to 95 neural networks 
returned to popularity. In 1988 there was a resurgence of probabilistic and decision 
theoretic methods.

Earlier AI systems used very general systems of little knowledge but recent AI systems 
use specialized knowledge to perform specific tasks.

In 1990s there have been major advances in all areas of AI including machine learning, 
intelligent tutoring, multi agent planning, uncertain reasoning, natural language 
understanding, translation, vision and other topics. Rodney Brooks worked on the cog 
project at MIT which made significant progress in building a humanoid robot.

We have already looked at the deep blue chess playing program and we have interactive 
robot pets which have become commercially available realizing the vision of the 18th 
century toy makers. In 2000 the nomad robot explored remote regions of Antarctica and 
AI is a popular topic which is constantly in the news.

So this is the triple AI site which publishes news about AI and if you visit the site you 
will find that at any time there is a lot of interesting news on AI.

With this we will end today’s lecture and before we end we have a few questions.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 56:16) 
 
 
 
Question 1 is, define intelligence.  
Question 2: What are the different approaches in defining Artificial Intelligence?  
Question 3: Suppose you design a machine to pass the Turing test what are the 
capabilities such a machine must have?  
Question 4 is, design ten questions to pose to a man or a machine that is taking a Turing 
test.  
Question 5 is, will building an AI computer automatically shed light on the nature of 
natural intelligence, do you think so?  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 57:01) 
 
 
 
Question 6 is, list five tasks that you will like a computer to be able to do within the next 
five years. The last question, question 7, list five tasks that computers are unlikely to be 
able to do in the next ten years. With this we come to the end of today’s lecture, thank 
you.

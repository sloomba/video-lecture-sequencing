Lecture - 18 
Semantic Net 
 
In the last lectures we looked into different one particular knowledge representation 
scheme namely the rule based system. Our objective for the entire course is to look into 
different ways in which a system can demonstrate intelligent behavior. And one of the 
major components of demonstrating intelligent behavior is acquiring and using 
knowledge. In the last lecture we saw one such way of representation that is the rules. 
And we also concluded the lecture with one very important and popular application of 
such rules in the form of some of the expert systems which are rule based systems. 
Besides rules there are other methods and modes of representing knowledge.  
 
Today we will start discussing on a few of those other modes of representation of 
knowledge. So we will be looking at other knowledge representation formalisms and we 
will be starting with our discussion on semantic nets. Now, as you know the word 
semantic means meaning. So we are familiar with two words syntax which is essentially 
the grammar of a language and semantics is the meaning of any sentence for example. I 
may form the sentence correctly which may be grammatically correct that means it may 
be syntactically correct but it must be meaningful. In order to be meaningful it should be 
semantically correct.  
 
When do you say a particular sentence or statement is meaningful?  
A sentence is meaningful when we can really understand it and map it to some of the 
known concepts of the real world in which we live or see or can visualize or realize. So 
the essence of knowledge in one form is built around the different concepts that are 
spread around us. Whatever we look at for example, if I look at this room then I will be 
looking at different chairs, tables etc. now each of these are different concepts. And the 
chair for example is made up of wood usually. There can be chairs which are not made of 
wood that may be made of iron, steel or some other material. So whenever we talk of 
chair we can think of some other association with the material by which the chair is made 
of.  
 
Whenever we talk of chair another pertinent question can be what is the size of the chair? 
What is the weight of the chair?  
Whenever I use a word say a boy then obviously with that usage of the word boy it 
certainly maps into a particular concept within me because along with the boy I have got 
so many other associations. a boy will be at most if I call him a boy will be at most of say 
18 years old, whenever he is more than 18 years usually I call him a man or whatever. A 
boy will be having height, will be having weight, and usually may be going to school so 
there are so many other associations that come up. If I talk of tiger then immediately 
some concepts, the tiger is a concept and along with that I can associate how many legs 
does the tiger have and the immediate answer is four, what is the color of the tiger? There 
may be two possible answers white or yellow. So whenever we use any particular word 
we are actually referring to some concept and along with that concept we immediately 
associate some other related concepts. And this association of the different concepts 
builds up our knowledge system, our conception, our knowledge base. So this is another 
view of looking at knowledge that knowledge can be represented as a network as a 
connection interconnection of different concepts.  
 
Now, in semantic nets that is what has been explored how we can represent a domain 
specific knowledge using the different concepts. In today’s lecture we will see how we 
can represent the concepts and how we can represent the knowledge using these concepts. 
And also as it has been mentioned earlier that I cannot call any collection of facts or 
information to be knowledge unless I can use it use it for inferring some new facts. So, if 
I have to call this semantic net as a knowledge representation method or scheme then I 
must also have some particular inference mechanism by which I can utilize this 
representation to infer new things to answer different questions all these things we will 
have to look into and that is what we will try to see in today’s discussion.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 07:26)  
 
 
 
Now, the idea of semantic nets dates back to 1966 and in two very important papers that 
were written by Ross Quillian who was one of the early workers of AI and who tried to 
develop a representation of meaning. This slide has been titled as the thoughts about 
knowledge representation as it were in the 1960s. And also the subtitle is networks and 
meaning. That means that here we try to represent the different concepts in the form of 
network and also try to capture the meaning of the concepts in the network structure. But 
what Quillian tried to do is to represent different concepts as a hierarchical network, that 
is very important because if I just say, he is a boy or he is a man then immediately I also 
know that man is a concept but man is a mammal and I also know the concept mammal 
and there are many properties we share in common between man and mammals.  
 
And when I say Tom is a man and John is a man then both these other entities tom and 
John are also examples of man and they share some of the properties in common because 
of the relationship with the common concept man. Tom and John also share some 
properties of the concept mammal because all of them are connected to the concept 
mammal because John and Tom are man and man is a mammal. As a collection of 
different concepts organized in a network this is organized in a hierarchy or layer.  
 
Now this model was later on amended with some psychological assumptions because the 
original objective of all these exercises all these research was to try to understand how we 
the human beings think, how we represent our concepts in our mind. So there has to be 
some correlation with the structure of human semantic memory not that everything is 
known about it but a lot of research has gone in into this aspect by psychologists and 
whatever is learnt from them can also be utilized in our computer representation of 
knowledge semantics and meaning. In this approach of representing meaning as networks 
concepts can be represented as hierarchies of interconnected concept nodes. 
 
(Refer Slide Time 11:07)  
 
 
 
If I assume that one concept will be one node, for example, animal is a concept, bird is a 
concept, canary is a particular type of bird, stalk is another type of bird all these are birds 
and they are related to the concept bird therefore. But canary is another class of bird, 
sparrow is another class of bird but all of them share some things in common with bird 
and bird again being connected to animal will have some common properties with 
animal. So we can say that any concept has a number of associated attributes at a 
particular given level. We can say that the concept animal immediately tells us it has got 
skin, it eats, it runs, etc. All these properties are related to the concept animal. Similarly, 
we will have some attributes related to the concept bird.  
 
Now some concept nodes are super ordinates of other nodes. For example, animal is at a 
higher level than bird because a bird is an animal, a tiger can be an animal, a lion can be 
an animal, a crocodile can be an animal so animal is more of a super class or super 
ordinate of all these sub classes or subordinates like bird, tiger etc. Again if we go one 
level down the hierarchy from here we will see that bird is again a super ordinate of 
canary. Canary can be a bird, stalk can be a bird, peacock can be a bird, ostrich can be a 
bird all these are different types of birds but all of them are birds and all birds are 
animals.  
 
So in this example we can see clearly a three level of hierarchy at the top level as we 
have shown is animal. After that there is bird and bird is at one level lower than animal, 
more specific than animal. And tiger, lion all these things may be in the same level as 
bird. Now individual categories of birds like canary, peacock, and penguin come one 
level down that hierarchy. So in this example we have seen a three level of hierarchy but 
there can be multiple levels of hierarch. So the essence of this idea is that we can 
organize the different concepts at different levels and all these concepts may have some 
relationship from one level to another. That is the basic idea and each of these concepts 
will have some attributes specified at that level. Like animal we will have attributes, bird 
we will some additional attributes etc.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 14:40) 
 
 
 
However, we cannot store in a computer or might be in our human mind also we do not 
explicitly store everything. So we often talk of cognitive economy. That means how 
much we store. So, for reasons of cognitive economy subordinates inherit all the 
attributes of their super ordinate concepts. So what does it mean? It means that if I had 
specified something about bird then those attributes will be inherited by whoever are the 
descendants in that hierarchy. Here is an example, I can say that mammal is a category so 
here I can say human and I can say might be some animals and they are related. This is at 
the top level L0 and this is at level L1. Now human beings can have some attribute, this is 
an attribute link which says has and I write down another concept hands. Now, if I draw 
another level down here can be man and here can be woman. Now man is linked to 
human it is down this level L2.  
 
Now man can have some additional properties, woman can have additional properties 
over human but whatever is there as a property of human will also be there for both man 
and woman. If it was not the case if I just go on adding properties at the human level like 
color of blood the color of blood is red, now if I had to store everything here then I had to 
store has, hands, color of blood, red etc. But this part is not required to be stored 
explicitly. I would have to store it here as well as for woman and everything so I do not 
need to store this here because it is already stored at the upper level so I do not need to 
store this part here and it is sufficient to store at the parent level or the higher level. This 
is what is meant by cognitive economy.  
 
That means I do not want to store all the attributes at all the levels instead whatever is 
there at the top level say mammal I can certainly say it drinks milk or born from mother 
whatever it is. Then all the concepts which are children of this level will inherit these 
properties that are there at the top level. That is the basic concept of this sentence that is 
for reasons of cognitive economy subordinates that means whichever are down the 
hierarchy inherit all the attributes of the super ordinate concepts. Now for some instances 
of the concepts there are exceptions from the attributes that help us to define the super 
ordinates.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 19:08)  
 
 
 
Let us take one example, a typical classical example is, when we say bird, bird is a 
concept then birds can fly, what is the locomotion of birds? It is flying, how do they 
move? They move by flying so if it is a sparrow it is a type of bird then obviously it will 
be automatically inferred that sparrow is a bird and I know birds can fly so sparrows can 
fly. This is what we can inherit from the parent category. But ostrich is an exception 
ostrich cannot fly but ostrich is a bird. It has got all other attributes that a bird has such as 
feathers, wings, two legs, has a beak all those things but only the locomotion is an 
exception. Therefore at the subordinate level I may need to modify some of the attributes 
in special cases which are exceptions. So the general rule we that we can think of is, 
usually we will inherit all the attributes of the parent but at the lower level we can modify 
them in special cases as required. Various processes search these hierarchies for 
information. Here is a hierarchical network that we are talking about.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 21:24)  
 
 
 
What is the super ordinate in this hierarchy? We have got animal, this is the super class 
the top level. Now we have got bird, we have got fish. Now these are related to this 
concept animal. Each of these ovals represent one concept. this oval represents bird and 
look at this green link the name of this green link or this green link is leveled with is-a 
that means bird is a animal, in proper English it should be is an animal but we are not 
making a distinction, so here is-a means bird is a subordinate of this super ordinate. 
Similarly fish is a subordinate of this animal. Now look at these parts; this concept animal 
is associated with some properties like can breathe, can eat, has skin etc. Now this can 
and has are different attributes of this concept animal.  
 
Similarly, bird has got some additional attributes like can fly, has wings etc. I cannot say 
that animals have wings because all animals will not have wings. But bird can fly, has 
wings, and has feathers. Similarly, if we look at this concept fish we have got some 
additional attributes like can swim, has fins, has gills etc and fish is a animal. Now, if we 
go one level down the hierarchy we will see that these colored ones are even more a 
further specialization of birds.  
 
Canary is a bird, ostrich is a bird, and salmon is a fish. now note a couple of things here 
that if I look at this concept bird the bird as is written over here has got these three 
attributes can fly, has wings, has feathers. But just because it is a type of animal it is a 
subordinate of an animal the property of animal are also inherited, can breathe, can eat, 
and has skin. So, if anybody asks the question can a bird eat the answer will be yes 
because though I do not find that the attribute can eat is here in a bird I know that a bird 
is an animal and therefore whatever property is there in the case of animal will also hold 
here. Therefore I can say bird can eat.  
 
Similarly, if I ask the question can canary fly or does canary have feathers? When I 
described canary I just specified some specific attributes that are special to the category 
class canary can sing and is yellow, the color is yellow. But just looking at this I cannot 
say whether canary has wings. But yet I can say that canary has wings because I also 
know there is a link between the concept canary and the bird, the relationship between 
them is easy. So canary is a bird and I know that birds has wings therefore canary has 
wings. Similarly look at salmon, salmon is a fish and a fish can swim, has fins, and has 
gills. But salmon has got some additional specific attributes like lays eggs, swims 
upstream, is pink, is edible etc.  
 
Now straight away if I say does salmon lays eggs?  
The answer is yes because I can see that attribute right here. But if I ask the question can 
salmon swim? The answer is not here but if I follow this link I can see that salmon is a 
fish and fish can swim that means all fish can swim unless specified otherwise so I can 
infer that salmon can swim. If I ask can salmon breathe then the answer is not here so I 
go up this link the answer is not here as well but the answer is here you can see. Since 
fish is a animal it can breathe. But now let us look at ostrich. Now here I have written 
ostrich has got the attributes runs fast, cannot fly and is tall.  
 
Suppose this attribute cannot fly is not written over here in that case if I ask can ostrich 
fly?  
I will first look at the answer here and since this cannot fly is erased from here I will look 
over here and find well I do not find an answer here but let me try because ostrich is a 
bird therefore here is written can fly so the attribute of bird is can fly therefore ostrich can 
fly that would be my inference. But here in this case we have got specific information 
that ostrich cannot fly. So this attribute locomotion cannot fly or locomotion might be 
walks but it cannot fly that will have overriding precedence over whatever I know from 
the parents. So as I go down the hierarchy in this direction I come from the more general 
to the more specific. That is what we just now discussed that usually we take the 
properties from the parents but we go down as we go down we can be more specific and 
we can at times override the property at a lower level. So this is an example of a 
hierarchical network which demonstrates the different levels of hierarchy such as animal 
is in the top level L0, bird and fish is at lower level and canary ostrich salmon is at even 
lower level.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time 28:57) 
 
 
 
The same hierarchy here has been shown in red that ostrich cannot fly to show that it is 
an exception at the lower level. Now there are three things we have just now shown, the 
first one is called inheritance. Inheritance means any child concept. We will inherit all the 
properties of the parent concept. So canary, ostrich will inherit all the properties of bird, 
salmon will inherit all the properties of fish and in turn bird and fish will inherit all the 
properties of animal that is the first thing it is inherited with some exceptions. Specifics 
can be more detailed. Think of a human species, we inherit many of the genetic 
characteristics from our parents and that is exactly is what is happening here. It is the 
parent child relationship so in general the child inherits some of the properties of parents 
and the child can have its own properties which were not exhibited in the parent. 
Similarly here specifics can be more detailed and can be something that is inherited from 
the parent that can be overridden.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time 30:48)  
 
 
 
Through some psychological experiments that has been carried out and when the tests 
were tried on human subjects it was evident that the human subjects recognize 
propositions or statements which have lowered down the hierarchy much faster much 
readily than the propositions which are higher up.  
 
What are the propositions?  
If I say canary can sing that proposition is some how stored here. How is the proposition 
stored? Proposition is stored in terms of the attribute and the object relationship. Canary 
is an object having the attribute can sing so that is at this lower level. Usually human 
beings very quickly recognize the specifics when they look at a canary the first thing well 
a canary is yellow, a canary can sing, and ostrich? It cannot fly it runs very fast. But the 
thing in order to state the proposition is, canary has wings, canary can breathe they 
automatically do not come in because what you are looking or what you are perceiving is 
at this lower level and so whatever is very much evident in front of you at the lower level 
will have more precedence more importance and human beings quickly recognize that.  
 
But for recognizing, not that they cannot understand the other things they can also 
understand that canary can breathe but somehow the reason that canary is a bird and bird 
is an animal so all animals can breathe therefore the assumption is that canary can also 
breathe. One thing is ready acknowledgement another thing is acknowledgement through 
reasoning. It has been found through psychological tests that the facts which are at a 
lower level have got more ready acceptance to human subjects and that justifies that 
validates this model of knowledge representation. Till now what we have been discussing 
is, how concepts can be represented as hierarchical network. Now we can define semantic 
networks and semantic network is a structure for representing knowledge as a pattern of 
interconnected nodes and arcs.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time 33:15) 
 
 
 
Nodes in the semantic net represent concepts of entities, attributes, events, values etc. 
Arcs in the network represent relationships that hold between concepts. Therefore arcs 
are denoting relationships, till now we have shown only one type of relationship that is 
easy. But priory this part requires a little bit of explanation. Nodes in the net represent 
concepts of entities, attributes, events, values etc because I can also draw a semantic net 
in this way. Man is a concept and man is a mammal and man has got different attributes I 
can say number of legs, I can draw another type of node two that will be there in the 
mammal. Man, number of legs, number of hands etc or number of eyes can be two but 
there can be other attributes also like height. Now this height is less than 7 feet which is 
rather common. In that way I can have different types of nodes. This is one type of node 
that is representing a concept.  
 
There can be nodes which are representing values as well like these are representing 
values. All these together are giving me some statements; Man has hair and hair is a type 
of skin. Now all these things are concepts, has hair, we saw birds has feathers but man 
has hair and what is hair? Hair is a type of skin so here this is another concept, this is 
another concept, this is another concept and they are different entities and there can be 
also values so it is not necessary that only concepts will be nodes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time 36:46) 
 
 
 
In a semantic network we can have different types of nodes. Nodes in the net represent 
concepts of entities, attributes, events, values etc. Arcs in the network represent 
relationships that hold between the concepts. Here I have got so many other concepts. 
Now, when I store that in a computer I will store that with some particular type of coding. 
Now I will level the concepts and might be in a table where I will have C1, C2 etc I will 
have to encode each of those concepts and each of those concepts can have some 
attributes as well so I have to store them. Now here what we are showing is that C1 is the 
top level concept and I store C1s attributes. The next level is C1 1 and all the child 
concepts are leveled as C1 1 1 C1 1 2 so C1 has got two children C1 1 and C1 2 a sort of 
subscript notation that we use.  
 
So, in that particular way we can represent all these concepts. Now where is the 
meaning? We are calling it semantic network we have seen that it is a structure of nodes 
and arcs. The nodes are representing different concepts. Now, do the concepts by 
themselves express the meaning? No, the concepts do not express the meaning by 
themselves. In order to understand meaning of the semantics it lies in the structure as well 
as the relations that are there. For example, the meaning will quickly change when I look 
at this network and compare it with the earlier network.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time 39:12)  
 
 
 
This network has got two links salmon fish and animal are connected by is-a links and I 
just change at this level these two links from is-a to it. If I just withdraw these levels the 
other structures the concepts and the linkages are remaining the same but only thing that i 
have changed is the relation. Now, immediately the meanings have changed. Now what 
this structure means is, salmon eats fish and fish eat animals. Now I can no longer answer 
questions which I was doing earlier.  
 
Does salmon has fins?  
I look here and find salmon lays eggs, salmon swims upstream, salmon is pink, salmon is 
edible and I do not know whether it has fins or not and because I cannot now recognize 
that salmon is a fish that link that connection is lost. If I had another link over here is-a 
link then it would have been all right and I could have traversed through that is-a link and 
could have arrived at that answer salmon has fins. But as the structure lies now I can only 
say salmon eats something called fish which has fins. But whether salmon has fins or not 
is what I do not know.  
 
In fact it has become really a meaningless thing that fish eat animal and it is not always 
the case but you see how by changing the relations the total meaning changes and 
whatever I was able to do earlier in this case I cannot do any further because of the 
missing link here. So the important thing to state is that, whether we can represent the 
meanings and concepts in the form of semantic networks, the answer is yes we can do it 
but the meaning lies in the structure as well as the levels of the arcs and those are the 
relations we are giving now.  
 
We are talking of concepts, we just mentioned about propositions salmon eats fish that is 
a proposition, ostrich cannot fly that is a proposition. If you recall we encountered 
proposition earlier while discussing logic. So, is there any relationship or they are 
absolutely two different things? Can we represent whatever we are stating in semantic 
nets through logic? And whatever we are stating through logical propositions can they be 
represented in semantic nets? All these are very natural questions. Let us look at this 
example.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 42:27) 
 
 
 
Suppose this semantic net where we have got four concept nodes person is a mammal, 
person has part head, and Tom is a person. Now, here you see Tom is a specific person. 
So till now person is a category or class. Those of you who are familiar with object 
oriented systems, the concepts of objects, classes, sub classes will find a similarity here 
with the concept nodes we are discussing. But let me state here that the concepts of 
objects and object based design, object oriented systems came much later and has been 
systemized much later. These network concept of representation of meaning dates back to 
1960s as we have said so this is a predecessor. And it has been certainly much systemized 
later.  
 
Here if we talked about object oriented terminology then Tom is an instance of the class 
person. If I have added a node here man is a person, woman is a person then man woman 
are still classes I am not talking of a particular man or particular woman but Tom is a 
particular person and through this is-a links in semantic nets I cannot make this 
distinction between whether it is an instance or a class. Here Tom is a person, person is a 
mammal and person has part head. So, if we just look at this part I can answer some 
questions.  
 
Does tom have a head?  
Yes I can answer Tom is a person and person has part head so Tom has head. And 
whatever were the attributes of the mammal I could have also talked about those 
attributes to be valid for Tom. Now the same structure can be represented in logic where I 
just use these relations as the predicates. Is a person mammal is a person mammal so it is 
a binary predicate with two attributes. Now, in logic I can say instance Tom person that 
Tom is a instance of a person, has part person head. If you take any two partitions and the 
relation connecting them I can represent them as propositions as we do in logic.  
 
We started with the point that we want to represent the concepts and the meaning because 
that is essential to represent knowledge. And we have seen that concepts can be restored 
or represented in a form of a hierarchical network and using this idea the semantic net 
representation came into being where it consists of nodes and arcs and the nodes 
represent concepts, entities, events, values and the arcs represent different attributes. That 
is how we can represent different facts that we want to state or model about the real 
world. Now let us see how we can represent some more facts in semantic nets. Suppose 
there is a game being played between two teams Norwich and Spurs. Now one team is a 
winner and another is a loser.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 46:45)  
 
 
 
Now how do you represent that fact that Norwich defeated Spurs? I just want to say 
Norwich was the winner spurs is loser. Norwich is a winner of what? So winner of a 
particular game which I have just named here G5 and what is G5? G5 is a game and any 
game will have a winner and loser so Norwich is the winner and Spurs is loser. Now, if I 
want to state it was a football match and Norwich defeated Spurs with a score 3 for 1 then 
I have to add another attribute score 3 and 1. Let us forget about what is written below 
and look at this white thing.  
 
Now what can we say about this?  
We can say G5 was a game that was played in some particular ground, I could have even 
stated G5 played at, I could have added a particular arc over here saying that it was 
played at some particular football ground and the attribute G5 is a game and it has got a 
winner and loser so I can say that in the game G5 Norwich was the winner and Spurs is 
the loser. And if I look at this I can also say that the result of game G5 was 3 1.  
 
Typically earlier what we have seen is, when we take these two nodes and look at the 
relation between them what we represent is a two place predicate a predicate is-a which 
can take two parameters. But often we may need to represent facts with more than two 
parameters. For example, Norwich Spurs, Norwich defeated Spurs with a score 3 1 or the 
score of Norwich over Spurs was 3 1. Now this is a three place predicate, now how do 
you do this? In order to do this if I had just taken these two I would have said Spurs was 
the loser in game G5. If I had just taken these two I would have said Norwich was the 
winner in game G5. If I had said what is G5 then I would have looked into these two 
nodes and would have said G5 is a game. If I had taken these two I would have asked 
what is the score of G5? The score of G5 is 3 1. All these were two place predicates.  
 
But whenever we need to represent three place predicates I need to create a new node this 
new node has to be created otherwise I could have just said game in this game there is a 
winner and loser I could have said spurs and Norwich. But the score of different games 
will differ so I may need to create a particular node which will specify the additional fact. 
We will see some more examples from here. For example, if we look at this point we see 
that it is a more complicated example which we are trying to show: John gave Mary the 
book; John gave the book to Mary. Now how do you represent this? We have shown that 
gave is an action, giving this book to Mary is a particular event and this event of giving 
has got an agent as somebody who gives and somebody who receives. Any giving will 
have two requirements. Somebody will have to give and somebody has to receive. The 
person who is giving is an agent and the person who is receiving is a recipient. Therefore 
for an event of giving the action is giving, it has an agent John and a recipient Mary.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 51:21) 
 
 
 
Now what is being given?  
The object that is being given is a book.  
What is that?  
It is a particular book. I am not saying John gave Mary a book but I am saying John gave 
Mary the book so I am talking of a particular book so I can say John gave Mary this 
giving event has got an object I can give you the pen, I can give you the money so giving 
is an action which has got a giver, which has got a recipient and also some object that is 
being given. There is more of it like how it is being given, when it is being given etc. 
John gave Mary the book. So the object that is being given I could have said book but 
why I did not say it is a book because book is a general class and we are talking of a 
particular book that is book 69 and what is this book 69? It is an instance of book.  
 
So you see how this English statement John gave Mary the book simply translates to this 
nice semantic net form. Now here we have got these where all these are entities, event 
John Mary book 69, book is a class, giving is a class, these are concepts of giving. I could 
have written over here given also but this particular node is gave because its tense is past 
which is a type of giving where the tense is past and I can make it more detailed therefore 
this is one example.  
 
(Refer Slide Time 53:15)  
 
 
 
Let us look at another example; suppose we are asked to build a semantic net hat 
represents the following knowledge. We have just now shown that given a particular 
semantic net how that can be represented in the form of logic. Now what we are showing 
in this example is, given some logical statements can we draw a semantic net with that? 
So let us look at these statements; Man Marcus that means Marcus is a man, married 
Marcus Madonna so Marcus is married to Madonna so these are propositions. Gave to 
Madonna Marcus Measles that means Marcus was infected by the disease measles 
because Madonna had it so Marcus got it from Madonna. So this infection we are 
explaining through this gave to Madonna, Madonna gave to Marcus measles. These are 
three place predicates. So these three statements is a story.  
 
Marcus is a man, Marcus married Madonna and what happened was Marcus was infected 
with measles by Madonna. Now how do I represent this story in the form of a semantic 
net? Marcus is an instance of man so I take this sentence man Marcus, Marcus is an 
instance of man which is a concept, Madonna is another instance, Marcus is married to 
Madonna so the second statement is also covered and third thing is giving. Now Marcus 
and Madonna married and they probably gave so many gifts to each other may be so 
many other things were there but this giving measles is a particular instance of giving. So 
I cannot directly relate it to the concept giving it is a particular giving therefore I can 
denote it with a particular giving G17 is an instance of give action.  
 
Madonna also gave a book to Marcus so I cannot just say all the give actions are 
connected to this. This is a particular give action. Now what was given? Measles was 
given but of course it is a disease but here we are simplifying it. And who gave? 
Madonna gave and who got? Marcus got. Now I can look at the earlier presentation here 
and I can understand many things from these three logical statements and the same thing 
I can understand from this semantic net structure show here.

Later on let us see some more representation of semantic nets, how semantic nets can be 
used to represent more complex concepts and how we can infer using semantic nets and 
that will be followed by other knowledge representation schemes.
